Architecture:

The setup.yml and docker.yml are pulled in by the main playbook -- this is
responsible for ensuring that our demo, stateful app is initialized and running.
Ideally, for every instance of this container, theres one HTTP endpoint at port
800X which has been exposed to the system.

Future work:
    - ensure this works with a database backend
    - make "middleware" which acts to set routes
